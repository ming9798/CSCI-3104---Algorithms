\section{Standard 5- BFS and DFS}
\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS1}}
\begin{required} \label{DFS1}
Consider a \textsf{Modified Connectivity} problem:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsf{Instance:} Let $G(V, E)$ be a simple, undirected graph. Let $s, t \in V(G)$.
\item \textsf{Decision:} Given an integer $k\geq 1$,  is there a shortest path from $s$ to $t$ in $G$ that consists of $k$ edges? Here the length/weight of a path is defined as the number of edges of the path. 
\end{itemize}

\noindent \\ Do the following. [\textbf{Note:} There are parts (a) and (b). Part (b) is on the next page.]
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\item Design an algorithm to solve the $\textsf{Modified Connectivity}$ problem. Your solution should provide enough detail that a CSCI 2270 student could reasonably be expected to implement your solution.
\begin{proof}[Answer for Part (a)]

\newline
Create an array (I'll call it distance[0, 1, 2,...,v-1]) to store the distance of vertex i from the source vertex. Then, create an array (I'll call it previous[0,1,2,...,v-1]) so that previous[i] represents the previous vertex to the vertex i. \\ \\
Initialize a queue and store all the vertices and edges in it. \\ \\
Initialize a boolean array called visited. \\ \\
Use a for-loop to initialize all values in the visited[] array to false. This shows us that all the vertices in the graph have not been visited yet.  \\ \\
Set the visited[source vertex] to true and the distance[source vertex] to 0. The source vertex is not the first vertex to be visited and the distance from itself should be 0. \\ \\
While the vertex queue is not empty, we want to pop the first vertex out of the queue. Check if that vertex has been visited using the visited array. If it has not been visited, mark it as true to indicate it has been visited. Increment the distance value of that vertex by 1. \\ \\
Repeat this process with the next vertex in the queue until we reach the destination vertex. \\ \\
Initialize a vector to store the shortest path. \\ \\
Traverse the previous[] array and keep storing previous[i] into the vector until previous[i] is -1. This means we have reached the destination vertex. \\ \\
Print the vector to see the shortest distance.



\end{proof}



\newpage
\item We say that the graph $G$ is \textit{connected} if for every pair of vertices $s, t \in V(G)$, there exists a path from $s$ to $t$. Design an algorithm to determine whether $G$ is connected. Your algorithm should only traverse the graph once - this means that you should \textbf{not} apply BFS or DFS more than once. Your solution should provide enough detail that a CSCI 2270 student could reasonably be expected to implement your solution.

\begin{proof}[Answer for Part (b)]
%Your answer goes here

Create a queue (I'll call it Queue)
\\ \\
Create a boolean array of size [x] and set all the values in it to false (I'll call this array visited). This array will keep track of which vertices have been visited.
\\ \\
Enqueue the current vertex into Queue.
\\  \\
While Queue is not empty, dequeue the current vertex from Queue and mark the current index in the Visited array (visited[current vertex number] ) as true. Enqueue all the unvisited vertices that are connected to the current vertex into Queue.
\\ \\
When the while loop completes, check if there are false values in Queue. If there are no false values, G is connected. If there are false values left, it means that there are unvisited vertices and G is therefore not connected.

\end{proof}
\end{enumerate}
\end{required}





\newpage
\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS2}} 
\begin{required} \label{DFS2}
Give an example of a simple, undirected, and unweighted graph $G(V, E)$ that has a single source shortest path tree which a \textbf{depth-first traversal} will not return for any ordering of its vertices. 
    Your answer must
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    	\item Provide a drawing of the graph $G$. [\textbf{Note:} We have provided TikZ code below if you wish to use \LaTeX \ to draw the graph. Alternatively, you may hand-draw $G$ and embed it as an image below, provided that (i) your drawing is legible and (ii) we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.]
    	\item Specify the single source shortest path tree $T = (V,E_T)$ by specifying $E_T$ and also specifying the root $s \in V$. [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 
    	\item Include a clear explanation of why the depth-first search algorithm we discussed in class will never produce $T$ for any orderings of the vertices.
    \end{enumerate}

\end{required}

%		\draw[line width=3pt] (w) -- (t);
		
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
\\
 
b) The shortest path tree T if $E_T$ is 4 and root $s$ is 1 would be 1 to 2 to 4.
\\ 
\\
c) DFS will not produce the single shortest path because it has to traverse some nodes multiple times. In this case, in order for nodes 3 and 4 to be reached, nodes 1 and 2 have to be traversed twice. Traversing redundant paths can cause DFS to go into an infinite loop because it won't be able to distinguish between which nodes only need to be travelled through once and which nodes need to be travelled through more than once to reach particular end nodes. 

\end{proof}

\subsection{Problem \ref{DFS4}}
\begin{required} \label{DFS4}
	Give an example of a simple, undirected, weighted graph such that a breadth-first traversal outputs a search-tree that is not a single source shortest path tree. (That is, BFS is not sufficiently powerful to solve the shortest-path problem on weighted graphs. This motivates Dijkstra's algorithm.) 
	Your answer must
	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
		\item Draw the graph $G = (V,E, w)$ by specifying $V$ and $E$, clearly labeling the edge weights.  [\textbf{Note:} We have provided TikZ code below if you wish to use \LaTeX \ to draw the graph. Alternatively, you may hand-draw $G$ and embed it as an image below, provided that (i) your drawing is legible and (ii) we do not have to rotate our screens to grade your work.]
		\item Specify a spanning tree $T(V, E_{T})$ that is returned by BFS, but is not a single-source shortest path tree. [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 

		\item Specify a valid single-source shortest path tree $T^{\prime} = (V,E_{T^{\prime}})$.  [\textbf{Note:} You may again hand-draw this tree. If you wish, you may clearly mark the edges of $T$ on your drawing of $G$. Please make it easy on the graders to identify the edges of $T$.] 

		\item Include a clear explanation of why the search-tree output by breadth-first search is not a valid single-source shortest path tree of $G$.

d) In a BFS, the shortest path is determined to be the path whose edge-weight sum is the smallest. However, this may not be the actual shortest path if the shortest paths have edges with larger weights.

\section{Standard 6- Dijkstra's Algorithm}

\subsection{Problem \ref{Dijkstra0}}
\begin{required} \label{Dijkstra0}
Consider the weighted graph $G(V, E, w)$ pictured below. Work through Dijkstra's algorithm on the following graph, using the source vertex $E$. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly include the contents of the priority queue, as well as the distance from $E$ to each vertex at each iteration.
\item If you use a table to store the distances, clearly label the keys according to the vertex names rather than numeric indices (i.e., \texttt{dist[`B']} is more descriptive than \texttt{dist[`1']}).
\item You do \textbf{not} need to draw the graph at each iteration, though you are welcome to do so. [This may be helpful scratch work, which you do not need to include.]

\subsection{Problem \ref{Dijkstra2}} 
\begin{required} \label{Dijkstra2}
You have three batteries, with capacities of 40, 25, and 16 Ah (Amp-hours), respectively. The 25 and 16-Ah batteries are fully charged (containing 25 Ah and 16 Ah, respectively), while the 40-Ah battery is empty, with 0 Ah. You have a battery transfer device which has a ``source'' battery position and a ``target'' battery position. When you place two batteries in the device, it instantaneously transfers as many Ah from the source battery to the target battery as possible. Thus, this device stops the transfer either when the source battery has no Ah remaining or when the destination battery is fully charged (whichever comes first).  \\

\noindent But battery transfers aren't free! The battery device is also hooked up to your phone by bluetooth, and automatically charges you a number of dollars equal to however many Ah it just transfered.  \\
	
\noindent The goal in this problem is to determine whether there exists a sequence of transfers that leaves exactly 10 Ah either in the 25-Ah battery or the 16-Ah battery, and if so, how little money you can spend to get this result. \\

\noindent Do the following.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
\subsubsection{Problem 6\ref{Dijkstra2a}}
\item \label{Dijkstra2a} Rephrase this is as a graph problem. Give a precise definition of how to model this problem as a graph, and state the specific question about this graph that must be answered. [\textbf{Note:} While you are welcome to draw the graph, it is enough to provide 1-2 sentences clearly describing what the vertices are and when two vertices are adjacent. If the graph is weighted, clearly specify what the edge weights are.]

\newpage
\subsubsection{Problem 6\ref{Dijkstra2b}}
\item \label{Dijkstra2b} Clearly describe an algorithm to solve this problem. If you use an algorithm covered in class, it is enough to state that. If you modify an algorithm from class, clearly outline any modifications. Make sure to explicitly specify any parameters that need to be passed to the initial function call.

\subsubsection{Problem 6\ref{Dijkstra2c}}
